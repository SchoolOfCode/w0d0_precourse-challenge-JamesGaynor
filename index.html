          <h3 id="headline">Paul 'Trouble' Anderson made an immeasurable impact on the world of dance music:</h3>
         <p> Paul 'Trouble' Anderson is credited with helping to break numerous styles via his DJ sets including electro, boogie, hip-hop, jazz-funk and latterly house music from the mid-80s onwards.
      
      Born in east London, Paul grew up in various children’s homes and was a keen sportsman and dancer in the clubs before becoming a DJ. He first got involved with reggae sound systems, running with one that became called Troublefunk when it moved more into playing soul sounds - this is where he got the middle part of his name from.</p>
           
          <p> In 1985 he was a founding DJ at pirate station Kiss FM, and so was ideally placed to pioneer house music in London - on the airwaves and in the clubs. His seamless mixing style influenced many other emerging spinners from the era, and soon he was playing the big raves such as Sunrise and Biology as the acid house revolution swept the UK.<p/>
          <p>He stayed on Kiss FM for many years — ruling the Saturday night 9-11pm slot throughout the 1990s — before moving to Mi-Soul Radio. He continued to spread positivity and joy with his music both on the airwaves and in clubs until he sadly died on 2nd December 2018.  </p>
